# faang-network-biology
This repository contains Code and pipelines from the FAANG Integrative Genomics
and Network Biology (FNB) working group. 

Goals
-----
- Generate a panel of recommended methods and software tools that robustly integrate different data types with a focus on network analysis and to provide feedback on the quality of and feasibility of integrated/network approaches.
- Define community standards for statistical methods that make inferences from integrated  data and to develop recommended methods for establishing statistical significance (e.g. making sense of correlations and profiles).
- The group would discuss and evaluate database and storage methods for large biological networks using FAANG data.
- The group would advise other FAANG groups on experimental design issues relevant to downstream integrative genomics and network biology analyses (e.g. minimum sample sizes required for correlation-based network approaches).
- The group would establish an active, inclusive and friendly community for animal scientists interested in the application of integrative genomics and network biology.

Contributing
=============
Contributing to FNB is simple!

Development for FNB is discussed using github issues. 
If you are interesting in hacking and don't know where to start, check out the
[issues](https://github.com/FAANG/faang-network-biology/issues/) page for current bugs
and open feature requests. Feel free to comment one already opened issues for
clarification or to open an issue yourself! 

Development Cycle
=================
FAANG-IGNB has two main branches: `main` and `dev`. Development will be primarily on
`dev` and once milestones have been hit, versioned changes will be pulled into `main`.

Code will be incorportated into the FNB base after:
- A reference to a specific issue has been made in an Issue (which generated an Issue number)
- Upstream code does not break current test code
- Additional test code specific to added feature has been added
- A Pull Request has been made that specifically references the issue in question.

After contributing, contact us and we will add your info here!
