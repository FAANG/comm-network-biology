Contributing
=============
Contributing to FAANG-IGNB is simple!

Development for FAANG-IGNB is discussed using github issues. 
If you are interesting in hacking and don't know where to start, check out the
[issues](https://github.com/FAANG/faang-network-biology/issues/) page for current bugs
and open feature requests. Feel free to comment one already opened issues for
clarification or to open an issue yourself! 

Development Cycle
=================
FAANG-IGNB has two main branches: `main` and `dev`. Development will be primarily on
`dev` and once milestones have been hit, versioned changes will be pulled into `main`.

Code will be incorportated into the FAANG-IGNB base after:
- A reference to a specific issue has been made in an Issue (which generated an Issue number)
- Upstream code does not break current test code
- Additional test code specific to added feature has been added
- A Pull Request has been made that specifically references the issue in question.

After contributing, contact us and we will add your info here!
